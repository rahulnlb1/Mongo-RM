# mongo-rm1

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, open two cmd terminals.

In one of the terminal execute the command:

```
tsc --watch
```

This command would compile the TypeScript files to JS in watch mode.

On the other terminal execute:

```
npm start
```

This command would start the node application.
